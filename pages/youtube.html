    <h2>YouTube Journey</h2>
    <div class="card grid">
  
      <div>
        <h3>The Beginning: One Phone, One Room, One Vision (2020)</h3>
        
        <p>
          My YouTube journey began on <strong>19th November 2020</strong>, at a time when I had no technical equipment, no connections in the creator world, and no prior experience with content creation. Coming from a <strong>middle-class background facing financial constraints</strong>, I didn’t have the luxury of expensive gear, proper lighting, or even a dedicated workspace. I used an entry-level smartphone to record my first video, sitting in a small room without an air conditioner, often battling background noise and power cuts. My first content was focused on <em>YouTube tips and tricks</em>, aimed at beginners like me who were looking to understand how the platform worked.
        </p>
        <img src="/media/Starting journey.jpg" alt="Saksham Tyagi">
        <p>
          Every upload was a test of resilience. I learned editing through trial and error, researched overnight using free resources, and constantly pushed past technical difficulties just to share value. There was no blueprint or guide—I built everything step by step, often facing rejections, self-doubt, and slow growth. But I kept going, driven by the belief that I could make a difference for creators navigating this journey alone.
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <div>
        <h3>Discovering a Niche: Music Distribution Becomes My Domain (2021-2022)</h3>
        <p>
          As I explored different types of content, I noticed a serious gap in the Indian creator landscape—<strong>very few people were talking about music distribution</strong>, and those who were did so in complex terms or English-only formats. Independent artists, especially those from non-English-speaking or budget-constrained backgrounds, lacked access to clear and localized knowledge. So I pivoted—shifting my entire channel from general YouTube tips to the underserved space of <strong>music distribution education</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I immersed myself in every topic—from **ISRC and UPC codes** to **Topic Channels**, **Content ID**, **revenue streams**, and **metadata structuring**. I translated complicated industry concepts into <strong>easy-to-understand Hindi tutorials</strong>, often being the first in India to do so. The transition wasn't easy. My earlier subscriber base dwindled slightly during the shift, but I stuck with it, knowing this was a problem worth solving.
        </p>

        <img src="/media/Event Area youtube.jpg" alt="Saksham Tyagi"><br>
        <p>
          From designing my own thumbnails to writing full scripts, I handled everything solo. But something amazing started to happen—<strong>independent artists began finding my channel and thanking me</strong> for finally explaining things that no one else would. This was the validation I needed. It was no longer just about creating content—it became about building a **mission-driven platform**.
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <div>
        <h3>Breakthroughs, Challenges, and Building Distribution Blueprint (2022–2023)</h3>
        <p>
          While my subscriber base grew, so did the demands on quality, accuracy, and scale. I continued facing challenges like video delays due to weather (yes, recording during North India summers without AC was brutal), lack of team support, software limitations, and even having to re-record entire videos after audio glitches. But I refused to compromise. I developed research-driven content that became the go-to resource for artists uploading to platforms like **Spotify, Apple Music, JioSaavn, and YouTube Music**.
        </p>
        <p>
          This period also marked a major turning point: the creation of my own educational brand—<strong>Distribution Blueprint</strong>. This wasn't just a name—it was a full ecosystem. I wanted to offer **India’s first all-in-one guide for independent musicians**, and I made it happen. I spent months compiling everything I knew, double-checking facts, gathering screenshots, testing platforms, and eventually published my <strong>first book</strong>, also titled *The Distribution Blueprint*, in both **eBook and paperback formats**. Every chapter—33 in total—was designed as a step-by-step guide to help artists go from confused beginners to fully independent professionals.
        </p>
        <img src="/media/Saksham Tyagi Landscape youtube.jpg" alt="Saksham Tyagi"><br>
        <p>
          Around this time, I received something I never expected—an official <strong>invite from YouTube to attend the YouTube Creator Community event at the Google Office</strong>. For someone who started with a cracked phone screen and no mic, walking into Google’s space as an invited guest was a full-circle moment.
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <div>
        <h3>The Present: Leading a Category and Empowering Creators (2024–Present)</h3>
        <p>
          
          Today, my YouTube channel stands proudly as the <strong>number one channel in the music distribution category in India</strong>—and possibly beyond. The video quality has evolved, my presentation has matured, and my offerings have expanded, but the mission remains the same: <em>to empower every independent artist through honest, easy, and complete education</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I now receive regular DMs, emails, and video shoutouts from artists who credit their success to what they learned from my content. Some have gone from uploading their first track to managing entire labels—all because of the knowledge they found here. I’ve hosted virtual sessions, helped others troubleshoot release issues, and guided upcoming artists toward smarter decisions through content monetization, rights management, and marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite reaching so many milestones, I still produce content like that same creator from 2020: <strong>hands-on, grounded, and deeply intentional</strong>. My goal now is to transform Distribution Blueprint into a broader learning platform that includes paid masterclasses, toolkits, interviews with professionals, and more. I also aim to mentor a new generation of creators who want to become educators, not just entertainers.
        </p>
      </div>
  
      <div>
        <h3>The Future: A Decade-Long Vision for the Independent Artist Revolution</h3>
        <p>
          This isn’t a trend or a temporary passion project—this is a lifelong mission. Over the next few years, I want to build a proper infrastructure that supports thousands of musicians in India and globally—creators who speak different languages, come from different economic backgrounds, and still deserve a level playing field. I envision <strong>Distribution Blueprint</strong> growing into a **recognized brand in the music industry**, respected for its clarity, credibility, and community.
        </p>

        <img src="/media/Youtube creators.jpg" alt="Youtube creators"><br>
        <p>
          I may not have started with much, but what I lacked in tools, I made up for in intention. My YouTube journey is living proof that it doesn’t matter where you start—it matters how committed you are to helping others rise with you. That’s the legacy I’m building: one video, one artist, and one blueprint at a time.
